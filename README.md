# CanyonRacer

Canyon Racer is a game I developed for a term project in my CST 136 Object Oriented Programming class, Fall Term 2015 of my Sophomore year at Oregon Institute of Technology. Canyon Racer was created using the SDL (Simple Directmedia Layer) Library Using the C++ programming language. Currently the game is not completed, but is in working condition.
